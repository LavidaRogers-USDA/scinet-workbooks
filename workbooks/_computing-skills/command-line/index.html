The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a way to interact with a computer by typing text [commands](/glossary/#commands) in a program called a [terminal](/glossary/#terminal), 
rather than using a graphical interface like the one you might be familiar with in Windows. On High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures, 
such as [SCINet HPC](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/resources/index#hpc-clusters-on-scinet), the CLI is essential because these systems traditionally operate without a graphical environment 
(though web-based GUIs like the [OOD service](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/use/open-ondemand#open-ondemand-interface) are now available). 
The CLI allows multiple users to access and use powerful computing resources remotely. 
Itâ€™s also useful on personal machines for efficiently managing files, running programs in the background 
and automating tasks to save time.
