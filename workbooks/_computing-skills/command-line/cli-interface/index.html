## Overview

The [Command Line Interface](/glossary/#command-line-interface) (**CLI**) is a text-based way to interact with your computer, offering a more powerful 
and flexible alternative to using a graphical user interface (**GUI**), which relies on mouse-driven point-and-click navigation. To access the CLI, 
you use a **[terminal](/glossary/#terminal)**, which is the interface tool that provides a space for typing and viewing commands. 
By typing commands, you can perform tasks like managing files, running programs or configuring the system. Behind the scenes, 
a **[shell](/glossary/#unix-shell)** interprets these commands and communicates with the [operating system](/glossary/#operating-system) to execute them. 
Together, the CLI, terminal and shell form a powerful ecosystem for controlling your computer efficiently 
and performing your computational tasks with precision, speed, automation and a level of flexibility that is often unmatched by graphical user interfaces.

Discover the fundamentals of the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/concepts/), including its key components: 
the [Terminal](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/terminal/) *(interface tool)* and the [Unix Shell](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/), which interprets 
your text instructions *(i.e. commands)* entered in the [command line](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/commands/) input area.

## Terminology Explained

<div class='borderless' markdown='1'>  

| Term                 | Definition | Purpose | Key difference | Example / Appearance |
|----------------------|------------|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **CLI**          <br>[tutorial](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/concepts/)       | Concept of a text-based interface for interacting with the computer system. | Provides a method to execute programs, manage files, or perform system tasks by entering commands. | Itâ€™s a concept, not a specific software. CLI describes the environment in which commands are entered and executed. | |
| **Terminal**     <br>[tutorial](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/terminal/)       | Software/hardware interface tool to access the CLI or shell. | Acts as an interface or "window" to access the CLI. Historically, it referred to physical devices, but now it's mostly software emulators. | A terminal is just the container or access point for the CLI, but it doesn't process the commands itself. | GNOME Terminal, Windows Terminal, iTerm2 |
| **Shell**        <br>[tutorial](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/)          | A command interpreter that processes user commands and passes them to the operating system. | Provides users with the ability to execute commands, run scripts, and manage processes and files in the systems. | The shell is a program running within the terminal to interpret and execute commands. Different shells have unique features and syntax. | Unix shell: <br>Bash, Zsh, ksh, tcsh |
| **Command Line** <br>[tutorial](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/commands/) | The input area in the CLI (the actual line) where commands are typed. | Represents the input area (usually a single line) where a user enters text commands. |  The command line is a specific part of the CLI environment. | Usually preceded by a prompt, e.g., `user@host:~$` in Unix/Linux or `C:\>` in Windows. |
