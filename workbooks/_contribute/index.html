Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SCINet Workbooks!  We appreciate all of our volunteer contributors that help make this project successful.

There are many ways to contribute to the workbook, from reviewing existing content to adding your own tutorials.  
If you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact us via email or Github Issues.

## How It Works & Getting Started

To make edits directly to a page, you can click the "Edit this Page" link in the footer of the tutorial.  
This will create a fork on Github for you where you can make your edits and then submit a pull request to the repository.

For more complex submissions:  
  1. Fork the repo on GitHub
  1. Clone the project to your own machine  
      *  You will need Ruby and Jekyll installed to run the repo locally
  1. Edit the files or add files using your favorite editor
  1. Commit changes to your own branch
  1. Push your work back up to your fork
  1. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

If you're comfortable making contributions any other way, please feel free to do it your way and send us the pull request, we will gladly review the changes.

## How you can help

1. **Testing/reviewing published workflows:**  
  If you are following a particular protocol, please let us know if it worked or not. Also, we would be grateful if you let us know if changes were necessary to get it working! If you are familiar with GitHub, you can also make changes and send us the pull request. We only request that you include why the changes were necessary when submitting your pull request.
1. **Correcting typos or grammar:**  
  Typos and bad grammar can make a methods section difficult to read. If you have better way to elaborate a process, we encourage your contribution. If this is the case, please make those changes and send us the pull request. Alternatively, if a section is not clear or hard to replicate you can also open a issue/bug to ask for an expansion of the existing explanation.
1. **Contributing to sections of published methods**  
 There are often many ways to approach the same problem. It is also true that using a particular method over another may influence the final results. Hence, we encourage the addition of alternative methods to the existing workflows that may be more adaptable to your organism or circumstances. Otherwise, please follow existing conventions, and explain why any methodological changes may be necessary.
1. **Adding new protocols/methods**  
  Are we missing a favorite topic of yours? Well, we were just waiting for you to write that section! We are very glad that you noticed it, please add your section of interest and send us the pull request.
1. **Suggesting topics**  
  If you're working on a project and you're stuck with not knowing how to proceed, then please provide us the list of topics for which you may need methods. We will add it to our list or increase the method's priority in our development of this workbook.
1. **Sharing your methods with us**  
  No time to write or add methods? No problem! Just send us your methods/protocols, either as published papers, simple writeup, weblink, wikipage, or whatever form you have. We will try to convert it and add it our workbook, crediting you! You will also be added as contributor.
1. **Anything missing that may make the workbook more useful**  
  It can be anything, please feel free to get in touch with us! We will be more than happy to hear your opinion and adjust the workbook to make it more suitable to your needs.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to [scinet-workbooks](https://github.com/USDA-SCINet/scinet-workbooks).  Provide a clear list in the pull request summary of what you have done. Please follow our writing conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
  
***Always write a clear log message for your commits.*** <br>One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
  
## Writing conventions
  
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We can optimize for readability.
  
*  Self promotion is not allowed.
*  Use best practices whenever possible. There might be many ways to do things, but the goal is to make it smooth for beginners without being too confusing.
*  Do not use copywrited images or AI-generated materials.
*  Methods should be generalized, but we also strongly encourage public datasets used as examples. Please avoid using private datasets that are not accessible, allowing others to replicate your tutorials.
