- The example SCINet Workbooks module created following the [Contribute](/contribute/) guideline and [Formatting Toolkit](/contribute/format).
  - the module: [Computing Skills  -> Basics of Command Line Computing](/computing-skills/command-line/)
    - submodule: **Introduction to Command Line Interface (CLI)**, includes all types of content: introduction, lesson module, interactive tutorial, reference material


- Revised [Formatting Toolkit](/contribute/format): minor order rearrangement, improved descriptions, fixed insertion of source code, added internal cross-linking, improved formatting, unified style; re-formatted Front Matter example


**TODO:**

1 Fix the source code examples for Formatting Components
- [   ] [Dropdown or Accordion](/contribute/components/accordion)
  - replace `<div class="usa-accordion "  markdown="1">` with `<div class="usa-accordion ">` in all accordion examples
  - `markdown=“1”` should be kept only in `<div id="lorem-ipsum" class="accordion_content"   markdown='1'>`
```
<div class="usa-accordion">

{% include accordion title="Example" class="outline " controls="feature-1" %} 
<div id="feature-1" class="accordion_content" markdown="1">    
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
</div>
</div>
```
  - Automate assignment/naming of `controls` and `id` in accordion cards - it will be more robust. 

- [   ] [Alerts](/contribute/components/alerts)
  - the source code should be left aligned (no indentation)
  - `markdown=“1”` should be added to internal div `<div class="highlighted__body" markdown="1">`
```
<div id="note-alerts-1" class="highlighted highlighted--note ">
<div class="highlighted__body markdown="1">
<h4 class="highlighted__heading"> Example</h4>
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
</div>
</div>
```

2 [   ] Fix the backend of `{% include terms %}` as it doesn't link glossary terms properly; it creates links like these:
  - `/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/#:~:text=object%2Doriented%20processing.-,workbooks,-workbooks`
  - `/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/#:~:text=workbooks-,workbooks,-workbooks`


3 [   ] Center images in the parent dir by defaul. *(It will look better when images are shorter than page width.)*


4 [   ] Left-side navbar (table of content) -> make it sticky to page view; currently navigation is limited when the page is scrolled down;

*Optionally:*

5 [   ] Can we have 2 navigation key assigned to a single page, e.g., `interactive tutorial` and `reference material`? 
  - Can those tags/icons be also visible in the [Workbooks Index](/computing-skills/) and not only in the [Find a Workbook](/workbooks/)?

6 [   ] It would be better to add target _blank (open in a new tab) `<a href="https://" target="_blank">` as default behavior for all markdown-based links.

7 [   ] Tagging internal/external links could be helpful: for example “G” for glossary, “T” for entire tutorial, “S” for specific section, “W” for scinet website, “I” like instructions for User Guides on scinet website, “E” or “⤴” for all external links *(this works)*.

## Breaking changes
- Frontmatter variables changed. See workbooks/_contribute/format.md or (url)/contribute/format
- Folder structure changed - all Subject Areas should get their own collection folder and config specifications
- Flattened search page added per request.  Index is still filterable, but is separate
- Contribute section added.  Files are in the _contribute collection

## Bugs
- General QAQC needed to find and address issues
- Subindex filters are currently broken.  Section commented out while fix is in progress.
- Bug in Glossary if the user clicks on a Related Term link after filtering

## To-Do Related to Update
- Adding more usable components to Contribute section.
- Formatting and improving section ease of use.
- Fix subindex filter.

## General ideas
- Discussed that relocating certain content from User Guides (SCINet website) to SCINet workbooks can reduce redundancy and improve user experience. <br>
  Optional approach:
  - Maintain Index/Table of Contents (possibly in tables) for tools/topics on SCINet website with brief descriptions/category tags and comprehensive cross-linking to tutorials in SCINet Workbooks.
  - Organize SCINet website guides for easy searching/filtering with minimal update needs; ensure robust links to SCINet workbooks.
    - It serves as a searching/navigation guide: "What's available and where to find it?"
  - SCINet workbooks guides could detail exact settings or steps related to SCINet infrastructure (Atlas, Ceres, Juno).
    - It serves as a practical hands-on guide: "How to do X? How to use Y? How to get started with Z?"


## HOME page

### primary navigation bar
- Discussed removing the `Working Groups` tab from the top navigation bar.
  - Brainstormed alternative options for a "SCINet-workbooks playground" for users:
    - Individual GitHub repos under SCINet GitHub organization (to ensure content is searchable once projects are completed and published).
    - Shared folders on Ceres/Atlas with markdown files or Jupyter Notebooks.
    - Markdown documentation stored in the backend repo of the SCINet workbooks.
  - **Purpose:**
    - Encourage user engagement in contributing new content for the SCINet Workbooks.
    - Foster a habit of project documentation, benefiting users when publishing results.
    - Support long-term knowledge retention for the ARS and SCINet initiative.


- Discussed retaining the `Learning Paths` tab. <br>
  **Pathways** are designed as real-life examples of complete pipelines built from individual tutorial steps.
  - They offer more than just a list of links; they provide step-by-step guides with specific code blocks and explanations of parameters, along with additional intermediate steps (e.g., adjusting file formats) to move from one step to another.
  - Each tutorial serves as a building block or step that can be utilized in multiple pathways.
  - Pathways utilize specific tool settings required for a task, while tutorials offer in-depth descriptions of option sets applied for different applications or analysis scenarios.
  - Experienced users can follow pathway execution, while newcomers are directed to learn more (if needed) about each step or tool from linked tutorials.

### secondary navigation bar
- (optional) folding the `People` tab as a section under `About`;
- keeping `Contribute` as a tab directly visible in Home page


### content
- adding a brief (1-3 sentences about the SCINet Workbooks) + `Workbook Finder` button
  - placed just below the banner, so the `Workbook Finder` button is well visible
  - [ ✓ ] decided to maintain the current clean layout (without `Specialized Skills` workbook card and buttons)


## 0. Workbook's Landing Page

- URLS: `/core/` , `/data-science/`, `specialization`
- org: 0

### left-side navbar
- keeping the content as it is currently

### content
- keeping visual cards for **modules** (in a given workbook only) only
  - currently it displays items of the module (it will get clogged once we add more content for each module)
  - module card will link to the module landing page (link as currently in the section/module title)
  - style: keep 3 modules per row
- for `Specialized Domains` workbbok, treat the domians (bioinformatics, Geospatial) as modules in the core workbooks


## 1. Module's Landing Page

- URL: e.g., `/core/devel-environment/index` ("index" could be removed from the URL)
- org: 1

### left-side navbar
- removing `Workbook Index` item from the navbar (because it is visible just below the brief about)
- adding shortcut names for the items (**sections**) at the next nested level (i.e., `org = 2`)
  - adding a new front matter variable with the shortcut name used in the left-side navbar (TOC), e.g. **IDE basics**, **Universal IDE**, **IDE for Python**, **IDE for R**

### content
- brief to the module (as currently)
- table of content (as current `Workbook Index`)
  - optional renaming to TOC as it is an organized list (Index is supposed to be alphabetically sorted), e.g., "Sections in this Module"
- `Workbook Index` list as it is now (keep complete list of sections and nested tutorials)

## 2. Section Page

- URL: e.g., `/core/devel-environment/python/00-python-programming-environment`
- org: 2

### left-side navbar
- table of content for the tutorial's content (as it is now)
- keeping the `Workbook Index` item in the navbar (because it is far at the bottom of the page), change `Workbook Index` to `Tutorials in this Section`

### content
- regular tutorial or introduction article (distinguished by the `type` variable in the front matter)
- Workbook Index` list as it is now (keep complete list of sub-sections (in this section only) and nested tutorials), change `Workbook Index` to `Tutorials in this Section`

## 3. Tutorial Page

- URL: e.g., `/core/devel-environment/python/python-setup/03-python-setup-locally`
- org: 3 or more

### left-side navbar
- same as level 2, change `Workbook Index` to `Tutorials in this Section`

### content
- same as level 2, change `Workbook Index` to `Tutorials in this Section`


## Workbook Finder Page

- consider moving options in the place of the left-side nav bar (left margin) and have them constantly expanded
- the box with the list can use 100% width (as the typical content)

- filters:
  - workbook category: the `wbs` variable is set as default in the config.yml for each workbook; no need to specify it in the individual tutorial's front matter
  - workbook type: `tutorial`, `introduction`, `pathway` (there also should be `index` or `landing page` type skipped from the filters)
  - workbook level: `beginner`, `advanced`, `professional`
  - topics: taken from tags in the front matter

- if no filters selected (default view), display it as it is now (alphabetically listed modules with nested list of tutorials)
- when filters applied, list individual tutorials along with the filtering tags (converted to action buttons) and add a tag for the corresponding **module** (if not among filters already)

# April 3, 2024

- Brainstormed about frontend layout of the platform.
- Discussed some backend implementations:
  - front mater variables: `org` and `ordered`
- Discussed options for acknowledging contributions
  - where: repo, website
  - what: ideas, code, knowledge, content, etc.

- Assumed workbooks as well-structured and pre-ordered without the need of repeating a module in few workbooks. Learning Pathways will mix-and-merge elements from various workbooks.
  - Individual tutorials in workbooks contain knowledge chunks or individual analysis steps. They work as building blocks. They will include examples and exercises.
  - Learning Pathways will cover the complete pipelines using the knowledge chunks and analytical building blocks, providing the comprehensive guide from raw data to publicable results.
- Considered Working Groups section as the playground and in-progress documentation for current research (testing or building new pipelines).
    - they can serve as a solid base for creating new tutorials
    - create the habit of project documentation
    - facilitate the publication
    - increase user engagement
    - it can be a coordinated effort of the working groups and the VRSC; overtime it helps build the SCINet knowledge base and in-depth background of the SCINet research scope
    - access can be protect by login


**TODO:**
1. [ ✓ ] create `_data/dev_notes` file to keep track of our development progress and ideas for exploration -

2. [ ✓ ] create `pages/styling.md` file to explain front matter variables and styling components (for developers and future contributors)

3. [ ✓ ] update css/sass solutions to directly modify the default USWDS styles

4. [ ✓ ] change backend nomenclature:
  - **workbooks** are the files in `_compiled` (including bioinformatics.md, data-science.md, geospatial.md, structure-dynamics.md, core-skills.md, environment-ecosystem.md, integrative-biology.md)
  - **modules** are all sections/categories established within each workbook; currently stored all together in `_workbooks`

5. backend:
  - [ ✓ ] check and (optionally) reimplement/simplify the ordering approach (`org`, `ordered` variables)
  - [   ] add the front matter variable with randomized value for each tutorial, serving as unique identifier (requires some more brainstorming about the best approach)
    - PURPOSE: easy cross linking and embedding sections of tutorials within other tutorials and learning pathways
    - make this variable easily accessible from the rendered website (to facilitate referencing in user-contributed tutorials)

6. in the Workbook Finder section:
  - [ ✓ ] remove the sidebar
  - [ ✓ ] remove the "Explore the Workbook collections" component
  - [   ] fix ordering of the modules within the "Filter Workbooks" component, i.e., sort alphabetically
  - [   ] convert category tag into the button pointing to the corresponding workbook

  Note: The workbook tags and filtering are currently not functioning as intended.
  - [ ✓ ] We could implement a simple workbook tag - it would currently show as "Core", "Data Science", and "Specialization"
  - [ ✓ ] We could have it pull from the url instead of the path.  This would give us "Core", "Data Science", and the various specializations.
    - update: set as the default `wbs` variable in the config.yml

  - Will begin outlines for a more robust filter for the Find a Workbook page, to facilitate increased tagging and filtration.

7. rearrange the main navigation bar:
  - [ ✓ ] Workbook Finder as the first tab
  - [ ✓ ] Home and About moved above the search bar
  - move User Guides (related to SCINet infrastructure) from SCINet website into SCINet workbooks (optionally, to consider) to improve user experience, easy cross linking and make both resources more compatible

8. There is potenial to adjust About to make it as a single link in the secondary navigation, with multiple pages within the sidenav of that page.
